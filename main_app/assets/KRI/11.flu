p;Lord, who may dwell in Your tent,
p;who may live on Your holy hill?
p;He, whose walk is blameless
p;And who does what is righteous.
p;Who speaks the truth from his heart
p;And has no slander on his tongue,
p;Who does his neighbor no wrong
p;And casts no slur on his fellowman,
p;Who honors those who fear, who fear the Lord.
p;He who does these things will never be shaken,
p;will never be, never be shaken.
